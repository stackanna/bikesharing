We were hired to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines Iowa is a solid business investment & proposal. A stakeholder inquired upon a bike trip analysis & we used the following for our research and findings. 

# Resources Used: Python & Pandas functions for the data & Tableau Public for the Vizualizations

# Summary 

For deliverable one we were converting the "tripduation" column from an integer to a datetime datatype to get the time in hours, minutes, amnd seconds (00:00:00). It was then exported into a DataFrame as a CSV file that we used for our visualizations in Tableau Public.
